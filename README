### Setup for local development (installing dependencies for IDE highlighting)

1. Clone Repo
1. Install Python 3.7
   - Newer versions of Python 3 will probably work, but won't match the PyGlue
1. Download [PyGlue.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-glue-jes-prod-us-east-1-assets/etl-1.0/python/PyGlue.zip)
   - Documentation around this can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm.html)
   - Put this zip in the project directory after cloning locally
1. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. (If using VSCode) Create `.env` in the project directory
   - Add a line adding the PyGlue.zip file to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. e.g. `PYTHONPATH=".:/Users/bskiff/projects/python-stuff/GlueTest/PyGlue.zip"`

### Running tests

1. Install Docker
1. Run `docker build -t glue . && docker run -it glue`

### Linting and formatting

```bash
make lint # checks linting and styles
make format # fixes style rule violations
```
