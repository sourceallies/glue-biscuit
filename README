### Setup for local development (installing dependencies for IDE highlighting)

1. Install Python 3.7
   - Newer versions of Python 3 will probably work, but won't match the PyGlue
1. Run:

```bash
make setup-local
```

### Running tests

1. Install Docker
1. Run `make docker-build` (doesn't need to be rerun each time)
1. Run `make test`
